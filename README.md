#Irrigation Pi

##This is a hobby-project where I am creating an automatic irrigation system that will:

1. check the probability of rain
2. if probablity of rain is <50 %, the system will water my garden automatically
3. temperature will be measured and saved to database every day at morning and evening
4. a photo of the garden will be taken and sent by sms/twitter/mail (?) every day at noon
5. there will an option to start the irrigation remotely
6. temperature, probability of rain and irrigation interval will be visualised with graphs

Possible extra features: Measurement of soil-humidity

##Tech-facts
I will use a Raspberry Pi B+ and Node.js.
